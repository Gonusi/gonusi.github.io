description: Programming experiments, things I've learned about, weird javascript and react stuff and a subtle hint of self promotion. A typical blog of a frontender.

<span id="greeting">Hi there</span>. You've stumbled upon my personal blog. I've
been programming computers, mostly in JS stack, for more than 15 years now.
Before that, I was programming them in amateur capacity too.
</p>

<p>
Mostly I've learned computers would probably do better without the humans, if
they could (they say they will now, soon, *maybe*).
</p>

<p>
For the last 8 years I've been working within the React ecosystem, while working
as an employee of a fintech startup, and for the last 4 - at a company
developing employee management software.
</p>

<p>
But now that I've started appreciating the thinking side more than the coding one,
 I'll instead try to just write about what I like and think
about, both as a person and a developer. Hopefully there will be at least something on the blog!
</p>

<p>
	I enjoy drawing childish illustrations, running, tinkering with arduinos, reading books, fixing up my old inherited farm house. Maybe some of that will appear here.
</p>



<p>
P.S. I'm from Lithuania, not an english speaker, and I try to keep this space as
personal as possible, meaning I will not use ML tools to edit the text, and you
can expect me to talk like this if you ever meet me. Yup.
</p>

<p>
P.S.2 The picture is more than 10 years old now but it's a good picture.
