<p>
	Hi there. I'm a frontend developer. For the last 4 years I've been working with JS / React,
	building finance & crypto web apps running in large Docker microservice environment.
</p>

<p>
	I've spent a lot of time on the "dark side" of things including authentication / authorization
	using custom authorization servers, JWT cookies and willpower to get through that stuff -
	debugging a lot of things I do not want to debug ever again (but I guess I now can).
</p>

<p>
	I also built landing pages for these apps, typically using either Gatsby or NextJS. This was
	what I used to specialise at Â±5 years ago, and that period of life accounts for another 10+
	years of experience.
</p>

<p>
	To be specific, we ran a small company - the "UAB Trys kintamieji", where I both created the
	designs, and implemented them. We specialised in (very) custom landing pages, presenting complex
	ideas using well thought-through, rich, animated experiences.
</p>

<p>
	This used to include a fair amount of thinking, product / audience analysis and idea generation,
	performance optimisation on all kinds of devices. I do miss this stuff a bit, but I still
	consult my old clients on ways technology can help their products provide additional value.
</p>

<p>
	All in all, I've been working in the field for more than 15 years, and it's incredible how much
	the field has advanced. I just hope the never ending need to learn will keep me young, forever
	:) .
</p>
