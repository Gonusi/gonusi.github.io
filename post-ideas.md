# Post ideas

- Set up a static blog about react components where you can test and preview them directly using cypress tests
- Net is a form of AI already, we're the "neurons". If we get exited enough, we
  post a comment, an article, which gets picked up by other neurons. All
  together, we form Earth, and move the main "organism" towards a certain goal,
  be it self desctructive or positive behaviour. 

Simple questions I can't find good answers to:
- cypress create callback and check if called with arguments: answers very
  simplistic, don't fit my complex object as argument. It's very hard to check
  it using sinon matchers, maybe I could somehow simply create a callback fn ()
  =>{expect inside this block? (doesn't work but maybe?)}
