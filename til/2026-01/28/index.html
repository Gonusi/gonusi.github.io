				<h1>Wood works and drawing hobby plan</h1>
				
				<div class="inner"><p>Today I learned that description for this TIL section is probably to be removed, as the the title is long enough to describe the ... short post itself.</p>
<p>I also learned that hammering a rectangular piece of wood into a space that is slightly smaller than it's dimensions is not gonna work. While it seems common knowledge, believe me or not, I spent 10 minutes frantically trying to disprove that. Shocked as I was by my own actions, problem was I had already applied glue and had to get the piece 80cm x 25cm piece of wood in the (too) tight spot until it set. When this did not work at all and the shelves started breaking, I frantically started kniving the non-fitting piece in rough strokes - turns out all the tools are at my cabin.</p>
<p>In the end it worked out OK, but from now on I will measure my rectangles more carefully and adjust with proper tools before applying them.</p>
<p>Yup.</p>
<hr>
<p>I also created an machine learning based learning / marketing plan for my recent ink drawing studies / hobby. I've decided that it's a good time to start work on my potential &quot;Ratsnack&quot; book - hoping to maybe grow at least the smallest of audiences and validating or disproving the idea (and my capabilities and making an interesting drawing + story).</p>
<p>While ridiculous, it's still plan, and better than nothing. It'll allow me to draw scenes while adapting ink shading exercises, and posting the results to some locations too.</p>
<p>That's mostly it.</p>
