Today I sanded and varnished the new DIY shelve for my kids. Turns out water based varnish will raise the grain of the wood, and it'll look very bad, one must sand it. I learned that sanding is one thing, but you actually seem to "burn in / rub in" the previously varnished surface a bit even until it's smooth - as it even works with a completely worn sanding pad.
