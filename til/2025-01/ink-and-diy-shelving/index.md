Today I was going through the [Ink drawing book](books/2026-01/rendering-in-pen-and-ink/) I've just started. I can tell this is gonna be useful cause I'm encountering various textures and shading ways I'll want in my own illustrations already (mainly organic leaf shapes used for shading).

I was working on my ipad, cause that's the main tool (instead of real ink + pen) I'm gonna be using for the illustrations. A very cool book, also nicely written / illustrated. 

An example of stuff I did.

I also learned a lot about real pens, nibs, ink. It's a world one could easily get lost in, as is the case with any truly useful instrument that is also a thing of beauty (if manufactured well). Specifically I was intrigued by "fude" type of pens which have bent tip allowing to get wide line not only by pressure, but also by rotating the nib.
