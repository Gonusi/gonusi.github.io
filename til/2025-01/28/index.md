Today I learned that description for this TIL section is probably to be removed, as the the title is long enough to describe the ... short post itself. 

I also learned that hammering a rectangular piece of wood into a space that is slightly smaller than it's dimensions is not gonna work. While it seems common knowledge, believe me or not, I spent 10 minutes frantically trying to disprove that. Shocked as I was by my own actions, problem was I had already applied glue and had to get the piece 80cm x 25cm piece of wood in the (too) tight spot until it set. When this did not work at all and the shelves started breaking, I frantically started kniving the non-fitting piece in rough strokes - turns out all the tools are at my cabin.

In the end it worked out OK, but from now on I will measure my rectangles more carefully and adjust with proper tools before applying them.

Yup.

I also created an machine learning based learning / marketing plan for my recent ink drawing studies / hobby. I've decided that it's a good time to start work on my potential "Ratsnack" book - hoping to maybe grow at least the smallest of audiences and validating or disproving the idea (and my capabilities and making an interesting drawing + story).

While ridiculous, it's still plan, and better than nothing. It'll allow me to draw scenes while adapting ink shading exercises, and posting the results to some locations too. 

That's mostly it.
