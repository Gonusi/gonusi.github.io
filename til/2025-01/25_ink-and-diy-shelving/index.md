Today I was going through the [Ink drawing book](/books/2026-01/rendering-in-pen-and-ink/) I've just started. I can tell this is gonna be useful cause I'm encountering various textures and shading ways I'll want in my own drawings already (mainly organic leaf shapes used for shading).

At the horror of any ink connoseur, I was working on my ipad, cause that's where I'm doing most of my illustrations. BUT, I also ordered a certain ink/pen combo. A very cool book, also nicely written / illustrated.

To see what I'm doing with this one could look into my other blog [sutemų dirbtuvės](https://sutemudirbtuves.lt) .

I also learned a lot about real pens, nibs, ink. It's a world one could easily get lost in, as is the case with any truly useful instrument that is also a thing of beauty (if manufactured well). Specifically I was intrigued by "fude" type of pens which have bent tip allowing to get wide line not only by pressure, but also by rotating the nib.

I also learned that my 3d printed modular tool designed for drilling straigh, well spaced holes in both walls and shelves... works wonders. However, a method I chose to secure the shelving was not ideal. The plan was to use only wooden dowels and glue. The drilled holes were nice and precise enough to match in all 7 * 3 dowel locations, but in the end, I was unable to perfectly weight, clamp or otherwise compress the glue and in some locations a gap of perhaps 0.5mm exists. I think the glue will hold cause it's not like that everywhere, but it does not make me proud at all.
