				<h1>Learning Ink shading, building tool to build book cabinet</h1>
				
				<div class="inner"><p>Today I was going through the <a href="/books/2026-01/rendering-in-pen-and-ink/">Ink drawing book</a> I've just started. I can tell this is gonna be useful cause I'm encountering various textures and shading ways I'll want in my own drawings already (mainly organic leaf shapes used for shading).</p>
<p>At the horror of any ink connoseur, I was working on my ipad, cause that's where I'm doing most of my illustrations. BUT, I also ordered a certain ink/pen combo. A very cool book, also nicely written / illustrated.</p>

<p>To see what I'm doing with this one could look into my other blog <a href="https://sutemudirbtuves.lt">sutemų dirbtuvės</a> .</p>
<hr>
<p>I also learned a lot about real pens, nibs, ink. It's a world one could easily get lost in, as is the case with any truly useful instrument that is also a thing of beauty (if manufactured well). Specifically I was intrigued by &quot;fude&quot; type of pens which have bent tip allowing to get wide line not only by pressure, but also by rotating the nib.</p>
<hr>
<p>I also learned that my 3d printed modular tool designed for drilling straigh, well spaced holes in both walls and shelves... works wonders. However, a method I chose to secure the shelving was not ideal. The plan was to use only wooden dowels and glue. The drilled holes were nice and precise enough to match in all 7 * 3 dowel locations, but in the end, I was unable to perfectly weight, clamp or otherwise compress the glue and in some locations a gap of perhaps 0.5mm exists. I think the glue will hold cause it's not like that everywhere, but it does not make me proud at all.</p>
