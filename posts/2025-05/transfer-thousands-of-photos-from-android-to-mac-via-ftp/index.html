				<h1>Transfer thousands of photos from android to mac via ftp</h1>
				<div class="inner"><p>Today I was preparing my old Samsung S23 Ultra for sale after moving to iOS for now. The app &quot;Android transfer&quot;, which <em>kind of worked some of the time</em> to transfer files from android to mac was no longer available though. The mac also refused to see the phone as a USB storage device despite multiple attempts to connect it (of course setting the phone to &quot;USB / files transfer mode). The &quot;media transfer&quot; mode also did not work (while trying to import via &quot;Photos&quot; app on my mac).</p>
<p>I then downloaded a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.medhaapps.wififtpserver&amp;hl=en-US">one</a> of the many FTP server apps available for android. I was able to easily connect to the FTP server just by using &quot;Finder&quot; app:</p>
<p><img src="./images/connect.png" alt="Connect to FTP server via finder"></p>
<p>However, the finder was super slow / crashed / lost connection to server often (due to 10's of thousands of images in the &quot;DCIM/Camera&quot; directory) and I was not able to transfer them successfully (apart from doing it manually in batches of like a 1000).</p>
<p>I tried to download an FTP client and, to my horror, on the appstore, all were paid (and I don't really need FTP for anything else at this point)</p>
<p>Fortunately, free options still exist, and ChatGPT wrote a script for me which uses <code>lftp</code>. To install via homebrew:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">brew <span class="token function">install</span> lftp</code></pre>
<p>Save this script <code>download-camera.sh</code>. I had problems with it being unable to create files / directories due to permissions / Apple &quot;System integrity protection&quot; stuff. So the script saves the results to your users home directory, which seemed to work (It will look like <code>/Users/yourusername/result</code></p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/zsh
set -euo pipefail

mkdir -p &quot;$LOCAL_DIR&quot; 2&gt;/dev/null || {
echo &quot;❌  Cannot write to $LOCAL_DIR — choose another location&quot; &gt;&amp;2
exit 1
}

# ── lftp batch ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
lftp -u &quot;${USER}&quot;,&quot;${PASS}&quot; -p &quot;${PORT}&quot; &quot;${HOST}&quot; &lt;&lt;EOF

--log=&quot;$LOG_FILE&quot; \
&quot;$REMOTE_DIR&quot; &quot;$LOCAL_DIR&quot;

EOF

echo &quot;✅  Finished. Files are in $LOCAL_DIR&quot;
echo &quot;   Transfer log: $LOG_FILE&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Make the script executable:
<code>chmod +x download-camera.sh</code></p>
<p>Run the script:
<code>./download-camera.sh</code></p>
<p>And it works - it sequentially downloaded the 25k of photos / videos over the few hours. I had to keep my phones screen on though, the FTP app seemed to go to sleep otherwise (I went to developer options of the phone, and selected &quot;Keep screen on&quot; option&quot;).</p>
<p>The models are truly becoming an UI for whatether you need - writing programs on the go. Cool but scary.</p>
