I bought this book from an overpriced stationary and writing tool shop, which everyone still visits cause it is so nice, and has a few books for sales matching the mood. I guess it's not that overpriced then as the values lies in the beauty of it but anyway.

I bought the book to prepare for my journey to Japan. Sure the book was set almost 50 years back, but I wondered if I could still fuyind stuff I read about by myself. The author traveled through the west side, which I did not visit, but the general atmosphere, I'd say, did not change. True, I had not finished the book at the time, but I did now and can confirm.
