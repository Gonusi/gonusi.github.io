People that know me will know I like to doodle and perhaps even paint. Since I've now decided to make my hobby a bit more public and directional by developing a book character, I've decided to also focus my drawing onto a direction I like. That direction is the "old kids book" style of ink countours and shading, supplemented by some watercolor coloring (or sometimes just the ink).

So, to start, I've started working with a (from what I've read) classical guide on ink drawing. This is that book. 

And I really like it. It's more of a workbook.
