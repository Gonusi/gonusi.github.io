I always enjoy travel books. It took me a long time to actually recognize I enjoy them more than being on a long journey myself. I got much happier once I did though. 

This one is a bit different simply because it's written exactly 100 years ago at the time of this post (1926). The book has language which, I imagine, fits the period well. It's a bit weird, there are words I have to look up in the Thesaurus. 

At the core, it's a book about how to perform long hikes (like 30days+). It suggests clothing, sleeping, routes etc., but nothing in too much depth. A short guide, perhaps then. 

What's interesting is mostly comparing the suggestions with current standards.
