				<h1>The Outrun</h1>
				<div class="inner"><p><strong>Author:</strong> Amy Liptrot<br>
<strong>ISBN:</strong> 978-1-78689-422-9</p>
<p>I went through the book quickly and really enjoyed it. It has a calming quality as you always know it will get better, more silent towards the end of the book, despite the start being hard. Perhaps I know this because I can somewhat relate, the nature mentioned right at the start of the book being just too beautiful to not turn to as the author struggles more and more with her affliction.</p>
<p>The book hovers around London and then the authors home land - the archipelago of northern Scotland isles. Mostly about Orkney and Papay.</p>
<p>It all starts with a painful description (not a memory - she was born on that day) of her father being taken away to a mental institution to the mainland.</p>
<p>The author then describes her raising struggle with alcohol. It comes on slowly, is described through interesting and relatable (by feeling if not always by the situation itself) personal experiences. The loneliness of the big city (even if the relation comes from perhaps being a &quot;citizen of internet&quot;), the feelings of being left behind as her group of friends moves on. The paradoxes of coming to big city to get to know different people, but in reality finding a safe group of identical ones.</p>
<p>Then the author experiences a crisis and successfully fights her addiction in a rehab. She kind of stumbles back to the islands, and, in her own words &quot;just get's stuck&quot;, but this turns out to be a good thing.</p>
<p>Finding solace in counting birds, the weird nature of the treeless islands, the abundance of weird fauna. The author tackles her own mind, but described it all in a very non-selfish, interesting way. You also want to experience that, but do not feel inferior about not doing it, kind of.</p>
<p>To be continued.</p>
